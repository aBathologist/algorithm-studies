#+TITLE: Algorithm Studies in C

Each file =./foo.c= contains an implementation of an algorithm or data structure
along with some tests or output to check correctness.

Any code shared between implementations belongs in
=[[file:utils/utils.h][file.{c,h}]]=.

The =[[file:Makefile][Makefile]]= is configured to generate the correct rules
for any new programs written following this pattern.

To build and run a single program, invoke

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./run.sh foo.c # or just `/.run.sh foo`
#+END_SRC

To simply build all the program, run =make=. The executables will end up in
=_build/bin=.
